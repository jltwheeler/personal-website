## Foreword

Hello world, I'm Josh Wheeler, a self-taught Software Engineer based in London.
As of the time of writing this blog post, I work as a Full Stack Developer for
an insuretech startup called By Miles.

In this inaugural blog post, I will go over why I have decided to blog and the
type of content you can expect from me. In addition, it is only fitting that I
properly introduce myself and summarise my journey on how I became a full stack
web developer. I will also highlight some of the key resources that helped me
on my journey, in the hope of assisting aspiring web developers.

## Why I Decided To Blog?

Blogging is an activity that I've always wanted to try, but sadly I've never
been motivated enough to find the time for it. It wasn't until recently, after
listening to [an informative episode][swyx-podcast] of the 'React Podcast',
that I finally found the inspiration to make time to build and write
my own blog. This particular episode featured a guest by the name of
Shawn Yang. Some people may recognise his handle, [Swyx][handle],
from twitter or even reddit - he is one of the main moderators of the
[/r/reactjs][react-reddit] subreddit. On the show, Shawn (Swyx)
talked about his upcoming book ['The Coding Career Handbook'][book] and his
concept of 'learning in public', which in short, is the practice of
publishing your learning on public mediums to enhance your self-development
and learning. It's also important to understand that learning in public not
only benefits your own development, but also others in the community.

I was instantly sold on the benefits of learning in public, both for my own
gain and being paying my learnings forward to others. So after listening to the
episode, I made a commitment to myself to build and write my own tech blog.
Whilst I haven't set any quantitative goals yet, I will aim to publish a new
post at least once a month. Though that might sound like a small commitment,
the key to keeping myself motivated is by working towards small achievable
goals. This is something I learned the hard way as a self-taught software
engineer.

## What Will I Be Blogging About?

With learning in public being a key motivator to starting this blog, I will
focus my blogging on things I'm learning / building and things I've learned as
a full stack web developer. Expect topics ranging from React and Node, all the
way to AWS and even Vim (❤️).

The blog will be targetting junior to intermediate level web developers
depending on the topic at hand. My aim is for at least **one** of my posts to
be of help to someone.

## Now, A Bit About Me

I graduated from the University of Western Australia in 2015, with a Master's
Degree in Civil Engineering and a Bachelor of Finance. Although I was exposed
to _some_ programming at university (MATLAB and Python), I never considered it
as a viable skill for a career (oh, the irony). After graduating, I started
working full time as a Highways and Traffic engineer at a multinational civil
engineering consultancy. In this role, I was fortunate enough to be involved in
the design of many major motorways and interchanges across Australia.

Although the civil engineering work was challenging, my heart wasn't truly in
it. It wasn't until one day, where I was 'fortunate' enough to be put onto a
_very_ menial data analysis task, that a light bulb flicked on in my head.
'Hey, a computer could be programmed to do this a lot quicker than me, so why
don't I have a crack at making that a reality?'. Using the knowledge I acquired
in my programming subjects at university, I spent the rest of the day and night
writing a script in Python that did the task for me. The script was a success!
What was previously a 4 hour manual task for a human to process, only took the
computer less than a second. I was hooked - solving problems via programming
was like a drug to me. From this point forward, I immediately knew I had found
my true passion.

I started taking programming seriously, going deeper into learning Python and
VBA (a lot of the manual processes were in Excel spreadsheets) in my own time,
with the goal of becoming quicker and better at writing scripts for
laborious tasks at work. As I got better, I started hunting for more and
more automation opportunities in our team. It eventually got to a point
where I was undertaking more development work than actual civil engineering
work. I was finally enjoying my job.

This sense of enjoyment finally gave me the confidence I needed to make the big
decision of completely transitioning out of civil engineering to software
engineering. In July 2019, I was lucky enough to find an opportunity in the
company's London office. The role of the job was to develop automation tools
for civil engineers full time, which perfectly aligned with my skills and
experience. Equally, my partner was also able to find a job in her field, so we
packed our bags and off we went.

Early on, I mostly developed Python applications that ran locally on people's
machines. It didn't take long before the shortcomings and frustrations of
deploying software in this fashion, led me to embark on a wild goose chase to
find a better way. This is when I discovered the excitingly overwhelming world
of web development. Somehow everything finally clicked, and I saw web
applications as the solution to all my problems I was facing at the time. This
realisation was enough to motivate me to begin my journey to become a
self-taught full stack web developer.

Fast-forward to 2021, and today marks my 2 year anniversary since arriving in
London. I now work for an insuretech startup, building full stack web and
mobile applications in Node.js and React. I also work a lot in the cloud with
AWS, deploying both containerised and serverless applications and working with
relational (postgres) and non-relational (DynamoDB) databases. With 1.5 years
of experience under my belt and many blood, sweat and tears, I would like to
offer some advice to others that may be starting their own journey.

## Self-taught Full Stack Web Development

So how does one even start learning to become a full stack web developer? It is
very easy to quickly become overwhelmed with the breadth of technology and
tools required for full stack web development. I assume this is what scares a
lot of people off early in their journey.

Upon reflection, I was very fortunate that a combination of passion, prior
knowledge and a heavy appetite for problem-solving was enough to fuel me for my
journey. But don't get me wrong, it wasn't easy. It took over a year of
very hard work and dedication until I was able to successfully and comfortably
build full stack web applications in the cloud. So please, don't give up!

There is a lot of information on the Internet. Knowing what is good, and what
is not so good is important. So, I would like to offer a list of resources that
were influential on my journey. Essentially, this is a list I would have liked
to be given when I started.

- [Udemy courses by Jonas Schmedtmann][jonas] - Although Jonas isn't the first
  name that comes up in a lot of the learning web development subreddits, he is
  easily one of the best on Udemy. His course content and the depth that he goes
  into is unmatched in my opinion. The things you build in his courses are also
  really fun and visually appealing, which helped keep me engaged. I would highly
  recommend his [JavaScript][jonas-js], [Advanced CSS and Sass][jonas-css] and
  [Node.JS][jonas-node] courses in particular. The course are always on sale
  through the year (~£10-15) so please don't pay full price for them!
- [Full Stack Open][fso] - After Jonas' course, I felt like I needed to learn a
  JS framework and extend my overall full stack knowledge. This is where Full
  Stack Open came in, a free online bootcamp by the University of Helsinki that
  deep dive's into modern web development. I can not recommend this enough. The
  no hand-holding, practical style of delivery is exactly the kind of course that
  really makes you learn. You are thrown directly into the deep-end from early
  on, but if you can swim, you will come out with a very well-rounded set of
  skills and understanding.
- [Developer Roadmaps][roadmap] - Let's be real. Learning full stack web
  development is bloody hard. The list of technologies to learn seems
  ever-expanding. This is where these community-made roadmaps come in. They
  helped me filter out the noise, and allowed me to hone in on the actual
  critical skills a full stack engineer requires in this modern world.
- LEARN GIT. Create a free GitHub account and start getting into the habit of
  committing EVERYTHING you do. Have a look at [this link][git] for an awesome
  list of git commands displayed by user stories.
- [Linux Journey][lj] - A lot of people put off using and getting comfortable
  with the terminal. DON'T DO THIS. Get used to it from day 1 please. As a
  developer, you will basically live inside the terminal for most of your day, so
  it's critical that you are comfortable with it. If you are using a unix-based
  machine i.e. Linux or Mac, Linux Journey is a great resource for beginners to
  learn the most useful commands for day-to-day work in the terminal. For a bonus
  tip, making your terminal look nice goes a long way with user experience. Have
  a look into using zsh (default shell with newer Macs) and the
  [oh-my-zsh][ohmyzsh] plugin to spice up your terminal
- [Syntax FM Podcast][syntax] - My favourite web development podcast. Again, in
  such a fast-moving industry, it's hard to stay on top of all the latest news,
  frameworks and tooling. Hosted by [Wes Bos][wbos] and [Scott
  Tolinski][st], the podcast keeps you up to speed with everything that's
  going on and there are many deep dive episodes to help beginners with
  certain topics. Definitely subscribe to this and listen to some older
  episodes.
- [AWS Certified Developer - Associate][aws] - Let's face it, with the rapid
  growth of the cloud in recent years, more companies are hiring full stack
  developers with cloud experience. I know... another thing you have to learn,
  but having a great foundation of cloud engineering skills can really
  set you apart from other developers. However, I would put this last
  in terms of your learning priorities as it's just a bonus. Learning
  cloud was possibly the most difficult part for me. Yes there are a
  lot of services to learn, but the hard part was understanding the
  underlying domain knowledge of infrastructure and networking. I
  recommend not jumping into AWS without the aid of a course. This
  Udemy course helped me get a better grasp of cloud in general, and
  also helped me obtain the AWS certification too. As a bonus, I
  recommend subscribing to the [Be A Better Dev][babd] channel - he is
  very underrated youtuber who delivers high quality cloud tutorial
  content.

## Conclusion

Yes, that was a long first blog. But I really do hope someone out there is able
to benefit from some of my advice. If so, please feel free to get in touch and
let me know. Otherwise, see you in my next post!
