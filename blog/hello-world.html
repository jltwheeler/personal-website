<p>Hello world, I&#39;m <strong>Josh Wheeler</strong>, a self-taught Software Engineer based in
London. As of the time of writing this blog post, I work as a Full Stack
Developer for an insuretech startup called <strong>By Miles</strong>.</p>
<p>In this inaugural blog post, I will go over why I have decided to blog and the
type of content you can expect from me in the future. In addition, it is only
fitting that I properly introduce myself and summarise my journey on how I
became a full stack web developer.</p>
<p>In addition, I&#39;ll highlight some of the key resources that helped me on my
journey, in the hope of assisting aspiring web developers.</p>
<h2 id="why-i-decided-to-blog">Why I Decided To Blog?</h2>
<p>Blogging is an activity that I&#39;ve always wanted to try, but sadly I&#39;ve never
been motivated enough to find the time for it. It wasn&#39;t until recently, after
listening to <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6zZwXsre7cdeUX10zqXBTb?si=tqYz33nNQq6QOox6frP8pQ&amp;dl_branch=1&amp;nd=1">an informative episode</a> of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://reactpodcast.simplecast.com/"><em>&#39;React
Podcast&#39;</em></a>, that I finally found the inspiration to make time to build
and write my own blog.</p>
<p>This particular episode featured a guest by the name of Shawn Yang. Some people
may recognise his handle, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/swyx">Swyx</a>, from twitter or even reddit (he is
one of the main moderators of the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs">/r/reactjs</a> subreddit). On
the show, Shawn (Swyx) talked about his upcoming book <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.learninpublic.org/">&#39;<em>The Coding Career
Handbook</em>&#39;</a> and his concept of &#39;learning in public&#39;, which in short, is
the practice of publishing your learning on public mediums to enhance your
self-development and learning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s also important to understand that learning in public <em>not only</em> benefits
your own development, but also <em>others</em> in the community!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instantly I was sold on the benefits of learning in public, both for my own
growth and for being able to pay my learnings forward to others. So after
listening to the episode, I made a commitment to myself to build and write my
own tech blog.</p>
<p>Whilst I haven&#39;t set any quantitative goals yet, I will aim to
publish a new post at least once a month. Though that might sound like a small
commitment, the key to keeping myself motivated is by working towards small
achievable goals. This is something I learned the hard way as a self-taught
software engineer.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-i-be-blogging-about">What Will I Be Blogging About?</h2>
<p>With learning in public being a key motivator to starting this blog, I will
focus my blogging on things I&#39;m learning / building, useful things I&#39;ve learned
as a full stack web developer, and any general documentation that future Josh
will appreciate. Expect topics ranging from React and Node, all the way to AWS
and even Vim ❤️.</p>
<p>The blog will be targetting junior to intermediate level web developers
depending on the topic at hand. My aim is for at least <strong>one</strong> of my posts to
be of help to someone.</p>
<h2 id="now-a-bit-about-me">Now, A Bit About Me</h2>
<p>I graduated from the University of Western Australia in 2015, with a Master&#39;s
Degree in Civil Engineering and a Bachelor of Finance. Although I was exposed
to <em>some</em> programming at university (MATLAB and Python), I never considered it
to be a viable skill for a career (oh, the irony).</p>
<p>After graduating, I started working full time as a Highways and Traffic
engineer at a multinational civil engineering consultancy. In this role, I was
fortunate enough to be involved in the design of many major motorways and
interchanges across Australia.</p>
<p>Although the civil engineering work was challenging, my heart wasn&#39;t truly in
it. It wasn&#39;t until one day, where I was <em>&#39;fortunate&#39;</em> enough to be put onto a
<em>very</em> menial task, that a light bulb flicked on in my head. &#39;Hey, a computer
could be programmed to do this a lot quicker than me, so why don&#39;t I have a
crack at making that happen?&#39;.</p>
<p>Using the knowledge I acquired in my programming subjects at university, I
spent the rest of the day and night writing a script in Python that did the
task for me. The script was a success! What was previously a 4 hour manual task
for a human to process, only took the computer less than a second. I was hooked
,solving problems via programming became an addiction. From this point forward,
I <em>immediately</em> knew I had found my true passion.</p>
<p>Over the next year, I started taking programming more seriously, going deeper
into learning Python and VBA (to write applications in Excel) in my own time,
with the goal of becoming quicker and better at writing scripts for
laborious tasks at work. As I got better, I started hunting for more and
more automation opportunities in our team.</p>
<p>It eventually got to a point where I was undertaking more development work than
actual civil engineering work. I was finally enjoying my job.</p>
<p>This sense of enjoyment finally gave me the confidence I needed to make the big
decision of completely transitioning out of civil engineering to software
engineering.</p>
<p>In July 2019, I was lucky enough to find an opportunity in the company&#39;s London
office. The role of the job was to develop automation tools for civil engineers
full time, which perfectly aligned with my skills and experience. Luckily, my
partner was also able to find a job in her field, so we packed our bags and off
we went.</p>
<p>Early on, I mostly developed Python applications that ran locally on people&#39;s
computers. But, it didn&#39;t take long before the shortcomings and frustrations of
deploying software in this fashion, led me to embark on a wild goose chase to
find a better way.</p>
<p>This is when I discovered the <strong>excitingly overwhelming</strong> world of web
development. Somehow everything finally clicked, and I saw web applications as
the solution to all my problems I was facing. This realisation was enough to
motivate me to begin my journey to become a <em>self-taught</em> full stack web
developer.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to 2021, and <strong>today</strong> marks my <strong>2 year anniversary</strong> since
arriving in London. I now work for an insuretech startup, building full stack
web and mobile applications in Node.js and React. I also work a lot in the
cloud with AWS, deploying both containerised and serverless applications and
working with relational (Postgres) and non-relational (DynamoDB) databases.</p>
<p>With <strong>1.5</strong> years of experience under my belt and many blood, sweat and tears,
I would like to offer some advice to others that may be starting their own
journey.</p>
<h2 id="self-taught-full-stack-web-development">Self-taught Full Stack Web Development</h2>
<p>So how does one even start learning to become a full stack web developer? It is
very easy to quickly become overwhelmed with the breadth of technology and
tools required for full stack web development. I assume this is what scares a
lot of people off early in their journey.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, I was very fortunate that a combination of passion, prior
knowledge and a heavy appetite for problem-solving was enough to fuel me for my
journey. But don&#39;t get me wrong, it wasn&#39;t easy. It took over a year of
very hard work and dedication until I was able to successfully and comfortably
build full stack web applications in the cloud. So <em>please</em>, don&#39;t give up!</p>
<p>There is a lot of information on the Internet. Knowing what is good, and what
is not so good is important. So, I would like to offer a list of resources that
were influential on my journey. Essentially, this is a list I would have liked
to be given when I started.</p>
<h3 id="udemy-courses-by-jonas-schmedtmann">Udemy courses by Jonas Schmedtmann</h3>
<p>Although <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/">Jonas</a> isn&#39;t the first name that comes up in a lot of the
learning web development subreddits, he is easily one of the <em>best</em> on Udemy.
His course content and the depth that he goes into is unmatched in my opinion.</p>
<p>The things you build in his courses are also really fun and visually appealing,
which helped keep me engaged. I would highly recommend his
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/">JavaScript</a>, <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/">Advanced CSS and Sass</a> and
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/">Node.JS</a> courses in particular. The course are always on sale
through the year (~£10-15), so please don&#39;t pay full price for them!</p>
<h3 id="full-stack-open">Full Stack Open</h3>
<p>After Jonas&#39; course, I felt like I needed to learn a JS framework and extend my
overall full stack knowledge. This is where <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://fullstackopen.com/en/">Full Stack Open</a> came in, a
free online bootcamp by the University of Helsinki that deep dive&#39;s into modern
web development. I can not recommend this enough.</p>
<p>The no hand-holding, practical style of delivery is exactly the kind of course
that really makes you learn. You are thrown directly into the deep-end from
early on, but if you can swim, you will come out with a very well-rounded set
of skills and understanding.</p>
<h3 id="developer-roadmaps">Developer Roadmaps</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s be real. Learning full stack web development is <em>bloody hard</em>. The list
of technologies to learn seems to be ever-growing. This is where these
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://roadmap.sh/">community-made roadmaps</a> come in. They helped me filter out the
noise, and allowed me to hone in on the actual critical skills a full stack
engineer requires in this modern world.</p>
<h3 id="learn-git">Learn Git</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/signup">Create a free GitHub account</a> and start getting into the habit of
committing <em><strong>EVERYTHING</strong></em> you do. Have a look at <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules?utm_source=tldrnewsletter">this link</a> for an
awesome list of git commands displayed by user stories.</p>
<h3 id="get-comfortable-in-the-terminal-and-using-clis">Get Comfortable In The Terminal And Using CLI&#39;s</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://linuxjourney.com/">Linux Journey</a> - A lot of people put off using and getting comfortable
with the terminal. <strong>DON&#39;T DO THIS</strong>. Get used to it from day 1 please. As a
developer, you will basically live inside the terminal for most of your day, so
it&#39;s critical that you are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>If you are using a unix-based machine i.e. Linux or Mac, Linux Journey is a
great resource for beginners to learn the most useful commands for day-to-day
work in the terminal.</p>
<p>For a bonus tip, making your terminal look nice goes a long way with user
experience. Have a look into using zsh (default shell with newer Macs) and the
<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh">oh-my-zsh</a> plugin to spice up your terminal</p>
<h3 id="syntax-fm-podcast">Syntax FM Podcast</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://syntax.fm/">Syntax FM</a> favourite web development podcast. Again, in such a
fast-moving industry, it&#39;s hard to stay on top of all the latest news,
frameworks and tooling. Hosted by <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">Wes Bos</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/stolinski">Scott Tolinski</a>,
the podcast keeps you up to speed with everything that&#39;s going on and there
are many deep dive episodes to help beginners with certain topics. Definitely
subscribe to this and listen to some older episodes.</p>
<h3 id="aws-certified-developer---associate">AWS Certified Developer - Associate</h3>
<p>Let&#39;s face it, with the rapid growth of the cloud in recent years, more
companies are hiring full stack developers with cloud experience. I know...
another thing you have to learn, but having a great foundation of cloud
engineering skills can really set you apart from other developers. However, I
would put this last in terms of your learning priorities as it&#39;s just a bonus.</p>
<p>Learning cloud was possibly the most difficult part for me. Yes there are a lot
of services to learn, but the hard part was understanding the underlying domain
knowledge of infrastructure and networking.</p>
<p>I recommend not jumping into AWS without the aid of a course. <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/">Stephane
Maarek&#39;s Udemy course</a> helped me get a better grasp of cloud in general,
and also helped me obtain the AWS certification too. As a bonus, I recommend
subscribing to the <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCraiFqWi0qSIxXxXN4IHFBQ">Be A Better Dev</a> channel - he is very underrated
youtuber who delivers high quality cloud tutorial content.</p>
<h3 id="learning-how-to-google">Learning How To Google</h3>
<p>Learn how to Google, and don&#39;t feel like an imposter for doing so. I won&#39;t go
into much detail on this point, as you can find a plethora of articles online
about this. But please, get good at knowing how to Google. Being specific with
the language, library and error message in your search goes a long way.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>That was a long first blog, so I&#39;ll wrap it up here. I hope someone out
there will be able to benefit from some of this advice. If the blog <em>was</em>
helpful or you just have a general question, please <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="mailto:jltwheeler@gmail.com?subject=%5BBlog%5D">get in touch</a>.
Otherwise, see you in my next post!</p>

Although I was exposed\nto \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e programming at university (MATLAB and Python), I never considered it\nto be a viable skill for a career (oh, the irony).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter graduating, I started working full time as a Highways and Traffic\nengineer at a multinational civil engineering consultancy. In this role, I was\nfortunate enough to be involved in the design of many major motorways and\ninterchanges across Australia.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough the civil engineering work was challenging, my heart wasn\u0026#39;t truly in\nit. It wasn\u0026#39;t until one day, where I was \u003cem\u003e\u0026#39;fortunate\u0026#39;\u003c/em\u003e enough to be put onto a\n\u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e menial task, that a light bulb flicked on in my head. \u0026#39;Hey, a computer\ncould be programmed to do this a lot quicker than me, so why don\u0026#39;t I have a\ncrack at making that happen?\u0026#39;.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing the knowledge I acquired in my programming subjects at university, I\nspent the rest of the day and night writing a script in Python that did the\ntask for me. The script was a success! What was previously a 4 hour manual task\nfor a human to process, only took the computer less than a second. I was hooked\n,solving problems via programming became an addiction. From this point forward,\nI \u003cem\u003eimmediately\u003c/em\u003e knew I had found my true passion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the next year, I started taking programming more seriously, going deeper\ninto learning Python and VBA (to write applications in Excel) in my own time,\nwith the goal of becoming quicker and better at writing scripts for\nlaborious tasks at work. As I got better, I started hunting for more and\nmore automation opportunities in our team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt eventually got to a point where I was undertaking more development work than\nactual civil engineering work. I was finally enjoying my job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis sense of enjoyment finally gave me the confidence I needed to make the big\ndecision of completely transitioning out of civil engineering to software\nengineering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July 2019, I was lucky enough to find an opportunity in the company\u0026#39;s London\noffice. The role of the job was to develop automation tools for civil engineers\nfull time, which perfectly aligned with my skills and experience. Luckily, my\npartner was also able to find a job in her field, so we packed our bags and off\nwe went.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEarly on, I mostly developed Python applications that ran locally on people\u0026#39;s\ncomputers. But, it didn\u0026#39;t take long before the shortcomings and frustrations of\ndeploying software in this fashion, led me to embark on a wild goose chase to\nfind a better way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is when I discovered the \u003cstrong\u003eexcitingly overwhelming\u003c/strong\u003e world of web\ndevelopment. Somehow everything finally clicked, and I saw web applications as\nthe solution to all my problems I was facing. This realisation was enough to\nmotivate me to begin my journey to become a \u003cem\u003eself-taught\u003c/em\u003e full stack web\ndeveloper.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFast-forward to 2021, and \u003cstrong\u003etoday\u003c/strong\u003e marks my \u003cstrong\u003e2 year anniversary\u003c/strong\u003e since\narriving in London. I now work for an insuretech startup, building full stack\nweb and mobile applications in Node.js and React. I also work a lot in the\ncloud with AWS, deploying both containerised and serverless applications and\nworking with relational (Postgres) and non-relational (DynamoDB) databases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith \u003cstrong\u003e1.5\u003c/strong\u003e years of experience under my belt and many blood, sweat and tears,\nI would like to offer some advice to others that may be starting their own\njourney.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"self-taught-full-stack-web-development\"\u003eSelf-taught Full Stack Web Development\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo how does one even start learning to become a full stack web developer? It is\nvery easy to quickly become overwhelmed with the breadth of technology and\ntools required for full stack web development. I assume this is what scares a\nlot of people off early in their journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUpon reflection, I was very fortunate that a combination of passion, prior\nknowledge and a heavy appetite for problem-solving was enough to fuel me for my\njourney. But don\u0026#39;t get me wrong, it wasn\u0026#39;t easy. It took over a year of\nvery hard work and dedication until I was able to successfully and comfortably\nbuild full stack web applications in the cloud. So \u003cem\u003eplease\u003c/em\u003e, don\u0026#39;t give up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is a lot of information on the Internet. Knowing what is good, and what\nis not so good is important. So, I would like to offer a list of resources that\nwere influential on my journey.
